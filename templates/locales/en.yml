          Doing an initial rsync...
        rsync_auto_new_folders: |-
          New synced folders were added to the Vagrantfile since running
          `vagrant reload`. If these new synced folders are backed by rsync,
          they won't be automatically synced until a `vagrant reload` is run.
        rsync_auto_no_paths: |-
          There are no paths to watch! This is either because you have no
          synced folders using rsync, or any rsync synced folders you have
          have specified `rsync_auto` to be false.

        rsync_communicator_not_ready_callback: |-
          Failed to connect to remote machine. This is usually caused by the
          machine rebooting or being halted. Please make sure the machine is
          running, and modify a file to try again.
        rsync_folder_configuration: |-
          Configuring rsync: %{hostpath} => %{guestpath}
        rsync_folder_excludes: "  - Exclude: %{excludes}"
        rsync_proxy_machine: |-
          The provider ('%{provider}') for the machine '%{name}' is
          using a proxy machine. RSync will sync to this proxy
          instead of directly to the environment itself.
